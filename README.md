(Ervin et al. (2023))[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07949.pdf]: Encounter 11 Conjunction between PSP and SolO from February 18, 2022 to March 4, 2022. Studying the source regions of the slow solar wind, specifically looking at the combination of PFSS & MHD modeling compared to elemental composition and charge state ratios.

Ervin et al. (in prep): Encounter 15 sub-Alfvenic slow solar wind stream. We identify the stream as emerging from a highly magnetized mid-latitude active region, and show the turbulence is dominated by a nearly incompressible slab component (-3/2 power law).
