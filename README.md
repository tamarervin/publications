(Ervin et al. (2023))[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07949.pdf]: Encounter 11 Conjunction between PSP and SolO from February 18, 2022 to March 4, 2022. Looking at the combination of PFSS & MHD modeling compared to elemental composition and charge state ratios to study the characteristics of wind emerging from coronal holes.

Ervin et al. (2024): Encounter 15 sub-Alfvenic slow solar wind stream. We identify the stream as emerging from a highly magnetized mid-latitude active region, and show the turbulence is dominated by a nearly incompressible slab component (-3/2 power law).
